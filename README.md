# Data Processing and Storage (EC) - Justin Lin

### Run Instructions

1. Clone repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/linjustin8/data-processing-and-storage.git
```

2. Make sure both a C++ compiler and [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) is installed and configured.
   - If on Windows, use link provided
   - If on Unix System, run command `sudo apt-get install cmake`
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
5. If on Windows run `./test.bat`
6. If on Unix Operating System run:
  - `chmod +x test.sh`
  - `./test.sh`
8. Test results will be displayed in terminal

*NOTE: *test.cpp will show an error*

### Assignment Modification

This assignment provides a great opportunity to gain experience working with transactions similar to how they would function in a relational database. However, I believe the assignment lacks rigidly behind which programming language to be used. Although that may be intentional to provide students the opportunity to work with what's most comfortable with them, it also creates issues when it comes to running the assignment and detailing instructions to students. For example, the assignment lacks instructions on how the tests should be demonstrated. If there were a set language, this could be set up beforehand, then students could be encouraged to follow a standardized set of guidelines on how they are to test their code. Futhermore, specific instruction won't apply to all students, creating confusion. This was shown as some functions were asked to return null, but in more type safe languages like C++, this may not be an option.
